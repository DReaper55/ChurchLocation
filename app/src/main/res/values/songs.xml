Have we trials and temptations? \n
Is there trouble anywhere? \n
We should never be discouraged; \n
take it to the Lord in prayer. \n
Can we find a friend so faithful \n
who will all our sorrows share? \n
Jesus knows our every weakness; \n
 take it to the Lord in prayer. \n\n

Are we weak and heavy laden, \n
cumbered with a load of care? \n
Precious Savior, still our refuge, \n
 take it to the Lord in prayer. \n
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee? \n
Take it to the Lord in prayer! \n
In His arms He’ll take and shield thee; \n

‘Fear not,’ said he (for mighty dread \n
Had seized their troubled mind); \n
‘Glad tidings of great joy I bring \n
To you and all mankind.’ \n\n

 ‘To you in David’s town this day \n
Is born of David’s line \n
A saviour, who is Christ the Lord; \n

 ‘The heavenly babe you there shall find \n
To human view displayed, \n
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands, \n
And in a manger laid.’   \n\n

Thus spake the seraph: and forthwith \n
Appeared a shining throng \n
of angels praising God, who thus \n
Addressed their joyful song:    \n\n

‘All glory be to God on high, \n
And to the earth be peace: \n
Good will henceforth from heaven \n

        Once in royal David’s city \n

        In a manger for his bed: \n
        Mary was that mother mild, \n
        Jesus Christ her little child. \n\n

        He came down to earth from heaven \n
        Who is God and Lord of all, \n

        With the poor, and mean, and lowly, \n
        Lived on earth our Saviour holy \n\n

        And through all his wondrous childhood \n
        He would honour and obey,\n
        Love, and watch the lowly maiden \n
        In whose gentle arms he lay; \n
        Christian children all must be \n
        Mild, obedient, good as he. \n\n

        For he is our childhood’s pattern, \n
        Day to day like us he grew \n
        He was little, weak, and helpless \n
        Tears and smile like us he knew \n
        And he feeleth  for our sadness \n
        And he shareth in our gladness. \n\n

        And our eyes at last shall see him, \n
        Through his own redeeming love, \n
        For that child so dear and gentle \n
        Is our Lord in heaven above \n
        And he leads his children on  \n
        To the place where he I gone \n\n
